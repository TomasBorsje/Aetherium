Aetherium is a mod focused around adding items, weapons, and accessories with interesting mechanics.

Warning: This mod is in VERY early development. Expect bugs or unbalance. Multiplayer may or may not work.

Current additions:

Vampire Charm: Stores damage done as 'charge'. Heals you upon taking damage, consuming charge. Drops from enemies on the surface.

Dead Man's Plate: Gain defense, and more defense the faster you're moving. Drops from enemies on the surface.

Flame Lantern: Summoning damage ignites enemies. Increases max minions & minion damage. Craftable.

Frost Lantern: Summoning damage ignites enemies in frostfire. Increases max minions & minion damage. Craftable.

Cursed Lantern: Summoning damage sets enemies aflame in shadowflame & cursed inferno if they are already alight with both frost and normal fire. Increases max minions & minion damage. Craftable.

Jade Quiver: Restores a tiny amount of HP when ammo is consumed. Dealing critical with arrows restores a larger amount of health. Increases ranged damage. Craftable.

Guardian's Resolve: Gain defense, and more defense based on the amount of Town NPCs you currently have. Drops from enemies on the surface.


WIP: (Subject to change of course)

Test Sword: Sword that changes damage each time you enter your world.

Overload Staff: Grapple hook that functions as a weapon.
