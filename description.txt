[c/7CE4FF:Aetherium] is a mod focused around adding items, weapons, NPCs, and accessories with interesting mechanics, rather than more of the same.
[c/FF4319:Warning: Aetherium is currently being revamped.] 
The mod is being rebuilt from scratch. Expect bugs or unbalance. Multiplayer may or may not work. Item icons, textures, & recipes are (mostly) placeholder. However, expect higher quality everything!
